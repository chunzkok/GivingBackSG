# Giving Back - Question 1
Question Statement:
Volunteering is one of the best ways to give back to our community. What creative ideas do you have to make volunteering easier, widespread, and more beneficial to those in need?

## Motivation
We chose this question because we realised that we had the shared experience of having to go through unnecessary hurdles when wanting to volunteer in the past. We have documented common user stories below.

## User Stories
1. I want to volunteer but I am not sure how to look for volunteering opportunities that are suitable for me. 
2. I want to volunteer with friends but all opportunities require individual signups, and we are not sure if we are going to be able to volunteer together as a group.
3. I want to be able to keep track of all my volunteering records and add them to my portfolio easily.
4. I want to be able to document my new self-directed volunteering experiences, but I had to go through a tedious volunteer-verification process with my school/organisation.
5. I want to be able to receive accolades for my volunteering efforts.

## Our Solution
We have decided to create a centralised volunteering platform where visitors will be able to quickly navigate to volunteering opportunities that best suits them. This means that visitors will be quickly able to filter events that are tailored to their preferred beneficiaries (such as the elderly, children, or animals).

### Telegram Bot
To augment the effectiveness of the whole system, we have created a Telegram bot that users will be able to interact with to record their new volunteering efforts, as well as to generate a summary of their volunteering efforts thus far.

#### Recording System
In order to make allow for volunteer events to be recorded rapidly, we have created a Telegram Bot that allows users to input a volunteer event code (unique for every event) that will quickly record the user's attendance and add the event to the user's profile.
